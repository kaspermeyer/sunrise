_Code challenge: Build a tiny DSL for writing HTML in Ruby_

We'll be doing code reviews every friday to compare solutions and learn cool new things!

After each code review I'll be adding tests for new requirements in `functional/dsl_test.rb` to keep you busy for another week.

## Weekly challenges

- [x] Week 1: Nested elements and attributes
- [ ] Week 2: TBA


## Development

####  Running the tests
Run the test suite with `rake test`.

#### Interactive console
You can run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

#### Adding new tests
Add all the tests you want under `unit/` and `functional/`
